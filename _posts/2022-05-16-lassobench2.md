In the machine learning community, we mostly rely on the [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S4leJbTrLg5) procedure for submission where reviewers and authors openly discuss the manuscript and argue if your work is sufficient to be accepted or not. 

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to change the mind of the reviewers once you get the first evaluation. However, this year at the spinoff conference of ICML [AutoML 2022](https://automl.cc/), I'm very happy to share that our work on LassoBench is accepted after two initial rejections and one weak reject. With an acceptance rate of 19%, this was a near to impossible task for us. But we did it! And the feeling is great! Rebuttals work if we do it with the right intention!
