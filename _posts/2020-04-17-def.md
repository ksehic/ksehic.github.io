After 3 years of "blood, toil, tears, and sweat", I would like to share with my friends and colleagues that I have successfully defended my [Ph.D. thesis](https://ksehic.github.io/phd_thesis) at the Technical University of Denmark related to uncertainty quantification and extreme events.

I need to thank the examiners for their time and the fruitful discussion that we had. It was my honor to receive your recommendation.

The thesis examiners were:

- Professor [Jan Sickmann Hesthaven](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ud0XpicAAAAJ&hl=th) - Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Schweiz

- Senior Researcher [Olivier P. Le Maître](https://perso.limsi.fr/olm/) - Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées, École Polytechnique
