Today is my last day at [Emulate Energy](https://emulate.energy/) after 3 wonderful years. I’m proud to have been part of a team that turns everyday devices like EV chargers, heat pumps and smart thermostats into “virtual batteries” that help people save money and build a smarter and sustinable energy system.

Coming from academia, it was truly rewarding to see my skills in optimization and data science put into practice, helping real people and the communities charge more efficiently and live more sustainably.

As I close this chapter, I’m excited to explore new opportunities in Data Science, with a focus on machine learning, optimization and uncertainty quantification. If this aligns with your work, feel free to reach out. You can also find more about me at ksehic.github.io

A big thank you to everyone at Emulate Energy for the journey. I’ll always be proud to have been part of it.
