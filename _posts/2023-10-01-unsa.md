I'm happy to share that I've been appointed as an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering University of Sarajevo](https://www.etf.unsa.ba/)! It's a tremendous honor to join this esteemed institution and contribute to the development of top-tier computer science talent in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
