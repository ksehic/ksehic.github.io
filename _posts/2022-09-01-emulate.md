excerpt: "... energy and sustainability for a better life on Earth."

After two years at Lund University as a postdoc research fellow, I'm excited to share that I'm starting my new role as a Data Scientist for [Emulate Energy](https://emulate.energy/aboutus/)! Energy and sustainability and primary concerns of modern society and our foundation for a better life on Earth. This motivated me to join Emulate Energy after working for five years at different universities such as DTU, MIT and LU. At this time of energy crisis, I'm looking forward to doing my part to help our society to keep moving forward. 

Futhermore, having unconditional support from Emulate Energy to go beyond standard practices and explore the unknown helps me to grow as a scientist.
